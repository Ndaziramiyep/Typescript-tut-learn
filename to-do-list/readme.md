1. Setting up the Project
First, initialize your project and install the necessary dependencies.

<h3>
mkdir todo-list
cd todo-list
npm init -y
npm install typescript --save-dev
npx tsc --init
</h3>

2. Project Structure
Create the following files:

<h3>
index.html
styles.css
app.ts
</h3>

6. Compile TypeScript
Run the TypeScript compiler to generate the JavaScript file.

# npx tsc

7. Run the Application
Open index.html in your browser to see the to-do list application in action.

This is a basic implementation. You can further enhance it by adding features like task editing, persistent storage (using localStorage), and more styling.
